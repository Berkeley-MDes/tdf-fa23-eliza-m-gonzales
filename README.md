# Report 2 - Week of 09/04/2023

Rhino and Grasshopper has been a really frustrating learning curve for me. Initially with the first file, I was distraught (to be dramatic) when I first saw the original phone model. Lowky- felt like crying.

HOWEVER- things have become better. Last week was a bit better in terms of learning how to use these platforms. I think my main issue was not understanding the fundamentals of the different tools and the actions they do. I took it upon myself to watch some Youtube videos just to get a basic foundation for how to use them, because I felt if I didn't then I wouldn't truly understand it.

## ü™ë Monday 8/28 Recap

It has been a long long week! But, I have made some really awesome progress and am ready to share what I've managed to complete thus far.

Earlier this week on Monday, I attempted to laser cut the basic model of the phone stand with no modifications with a fellow classmate, Abigail! It was a bit of a learning curve, but nonetheless we were able to figure it out. Most of it was just remembering how to work on Adobe Illustrator, and printing it to the laser cutter. 

Here are some of the awesome results we got!

## ‚úèÔ∏è Wednesday 8/30 Recap

After class on Monday, I wanted to try and explore Rhino and Grasshopper to make modifications to the file. Boy was that rough! I spent quite a few hours working on it and just trying to understand how it worked. 

My phone measurements for safe keeping üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª

üî∏ **Width:** 81.75mm 

üî∏ **Length:** 165mm

üî∏ **Depth:** 13mm


Here are some annoying b I ran in to:
1. **Vertical vs. Horizontal**

Attempted to make the stand vertical. I struggled with this for a while because what I initially did was reverse the input, so I put length into width and vice versa. Because of this, it was incredibly difficult to adjust the height of the stand itself. I tinkered with this for a LONG time. Finally saw there was an option for Portrait vs Landscape in GS, so started over

2. **Perspective??**

First of all, there are so many views, why?? Second of all, I learned NOT to drag one view into full screen, and to simply double tap the view I want in 4View. Cody was a miracle worker here, because I was deepyly confused.

3. **Plane**

Cody also helped me to set up a plane so I wouldn't lose the object so easy. It basically required typing in plane, placing it on the object, and making sure it's correctly dragged to the object. Great learning yay!

4. **Shake n' Bake n'**

Baking was easy! Learned that this should not be done in perspective view otherwise it was actually bake in perspective. There is a little vroom vroom car that shows it from the top view that was great. Baking was easy, but I just ran into a few issues with exporting this into Illustrator.

I also learned about the Move command and moving the baked portion to 0, because it was floating off into space and not showing up in Illustator.

## Outcomes
The final one wasn't put together very well, I believe it was to do with the sizing of the acrylic OR I need to adjust the holes they go in to. TBD!

Learning do be fun sometimes!
