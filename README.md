## 🪑 Monday 8/28 Recap

It has been a long long week! But, I have made some really awesome progress and am ready to share what I've managed to complete thus far.

Earlier this week on Monday, I attempted to laser cut the basic model of the phone stand with no modifications with a fellow classmate, Abigail! It was a bit of a learning curve, but nonetheless we were able to figure it out. Most of it was just remembering how to work on Adobe Illustrator, and printing it to the laser cutter. 

Here are some of the awesome results we got!

## ✏️ Wednesday 8/30 Recap

After class on Monday, I wanted to try and explore Rhino and Grasshopper to make modifications to the file. Boy was that rough! I spent quite a few hours working on it and just trying to understand how it worked. 

My phone measurements for safe keeping 👩🏽‍💻

🔸 **Width:** 81.75mm 

🔸 **Length:** 165mm

🔸 **Depth:** 13mm


Here are some issues I ran in to:
1. Attempted to make the stand vertical. I struggled with this for a while because what I initially did was reverse the input, so I put length into width and vice versa. Because of this, it was incredibly difficult to adjust the height of the stand itself. I tinkered with this for a LONG time.
