# Report 1 - Week of 08/28/2023
**Eliza Gonzles, Tech Des Found**

It has been a long long week! But, I have made some really awesome progress and am ready to share what I've managed to complete thus far.

Earlier this week on Monday, I attempted to laser cut the basic model of the phone stand with no modifications with a fellow classmate, Abigail! It was a bit of a learning curve, but nonetheless we were able to figure it out. Most of it was just remembering how to work on Adobe Illustrator, and printing it to the laser cutter. 

Here are some of the awesome results we got!
