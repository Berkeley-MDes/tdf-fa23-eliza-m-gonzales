**Conceptualizing our Idea**
Our concept for Rescue Ring was to create a product that would allow friends at a party to communicate with each other in a discrete fashion in case they‚Äôre experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, or just not having a good time. The idea here is that both friends would be wearing a ring with a Force Sensitive Resistor and Haptic Feedback buzzer. If one of the friends want to notify the other friend that they need them, then they would simply tap the ring and it would send a buzz to the other person.

**Level Selection**
For this project, I wanted to work at an Axolotl level because I‚Äôve never worked with photons before this program, and really wanted to learn more about this skill and explore what could be done. I figured if I worked at this level, then it would force me into learning more about photons and trying to make things work.

**Changes**
Originally we were thinking of doing something like a clip on that could be attached to your shirt, and this way you could tap it and/or feel it buzz. However, I noted that this may not be as discrete as we would want it to be. It might be a bit obvious on your clothing, and obvious when you're tapping it. Additionally, if you're wearing loose clothing, then you might not feel it buzz all togther!

As a result, I came up with the idea of "Resuce Ring", and more discrete and functional wearable.

**Contributions**
For Rescue Ring I took on several roles, particularly in areas where I had a strong skill set. One area that I was confident in was soldering. It came to our attention that no one in the group had substantial experience with this technique. Recognizing the opportunity, I not only executed the soldering tasks but also took it upon myself to guide my teammates through the process. This hands-on experience greatly enhanced my proficiency, and it was rewarding to witness the collective progress of the group. As we worked together, it was clear that my contribution was important in ensuring the successful functionality of our product, without taking much time away from other people to teach students to solder. Not only did this experience bolster my soldering skills, but it also gave me a chance to mentor and share knowledge with my peers.

**Communication & Particle Configuration**
We've spent a lot of time trying to make the particle board work. I managed to get some portion of it working, but still trying to figure out the vibration portion of our board.

**Brainstorming for the Particle Projects**
My group and I were trying to figure out what we wanted to do for our project. We had initially thought of overcoming language barriers by creating sunglasses that would translate real time conversations, but quickly realized that that would be really difficult to do.

We then decided to pivot! We're still staying along the lines of communication, but maybe considering between two people trying to discretely communicate.

**üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Rushing towards the finish line**

Last week I was able to come up with a great example for a phone stand in Rhino. Only thing was, I didn't find much interested in creating a phone stand. I have a lot of different tripods and stands for my phone already, and didn't want to waste product for something I might not use very often.

I started to think more about what I wanted to do, and what would be realistic to use on a regular basis. As I started thinking more about it, I really wanted to try and make a vase. I wanted one, and so I thought this would be a really cool idea.

I wanted something that had curves and wasn't fully straight, so I really liked the ones I found above. After than, I tried drawing out some sketches that don't really match, but still wanted to try and draw them gain that skill.

Something felt off with these thought, I realized that I actually wanted to try something a bit different. I wanted some texture and geometry so I could make it a little more diffitult (AKA Platypus level). So I drew out something that was a big more low poly and geometric. 

**Here are some images of my inspiration.**

And this is what I tried sketching to start working in Rhino!

# Report 2 - Week of 09/04/2023
**Overcoming Rhino**

## üöñ Wednesday 9/6 Recap

Rhino and Grasshopper has been a really frustrating learning curve for me. Initially with the first file, I was distraught (to be dramatic) when I first saw the original phone model. Lowkey- felt like crying.

HOWEVER- things have become better. Last week was a bit better in terms of learning how to use these platforms. I think my main issue was not understanding the fundamentals of the different tools and the actions they do. I took it upon myself to watch some Youtube videos just to get a basic foundation for how to use them, because I felt if I didn't then I wouldn't truly understand it.

THANKFULLY, TJ uploaded the wonderful video explanation that helped break down the cell phone stand project. Honestly I probably would not have had the understanding I now have without it. Thank you TJ ü´° Here are a few things that I now understand.

1. Setting a plane ‚úàÔ∏è

Originally Cody in the makerspace explained to me hoe planes work, and helped me set this in the original cell phone stand file. While it was really helpful, I didn't fully understand it in terms of the overall contribution to the project. We used it so I would not lose the phone stand and could type 'ZS' to find it. The walkthrough of seeing the plane in within the box and spheres helped to solidify where the phone lies within this realm.

2. Baking üßÅ

When I created my phone stand last week, baking was realtively easy, but I did run into some problems and learned what not to do. The entire process seemed relatively self explanatory, but alas- it was **_not_**. When it came to exporting, I didn't realize you could bake it several times, so in illustrator I literally had 6 layers to sort through.

3. Stabiltiy ‚éç

I  didn't even know that we could analyze our model within Grasshopper, so to find out we could find the stability of an object was pretty cool. If I'm correct, last week when I was adjusting the original file, I noticed that when I was trying to change my phone stand from horizontal to vertical, it turned red unless I manipulated some of the values. I probably worked through this for about 2 hours which was very very annoying. I assumed that it was red and not blue because something was wrong, but I now know more specifically that this was because it was not stable. Makes a lot of sense.

4. Shapediver

I didn't know this existed, so seeing the file outside of Grasshopper was interesting. I  really llike this because you can play with the adjustments without worrying about ruining the actual file. Something I know I'm always scared of.

## Overall
I'm feeling more confident in using Grasshopper after watching some Youtube videos and watching TJ's tutorial. Next I want to try and create something super simple from scratch, just to make sure I'm grasping all of the content correctly!

## ü™ë Monday 8/28 Recap

It has been a long long week! But, I have made some really awesome progress and am ready to share what I've managed to complete thus far.

Earlier this week on Monday, I attempted to laser cut the basic model of the phone stand with no modifications with a fellow classmate, Abigail! It was a bit of a learning curve, but nonetheless we were able to figure it out. Most of it was just remembering how to work on Adobe Illustrator, and printing it to the laser cutter. 

Here are some of the awesome results we got!

## ‚úèÔ∏è Wednesday 8/30 Recap

After class on Monday, I wanted to try and explore Rhino and Grasshopper to make modifications to the file. Boy was that rough! I spent quite a few hours working on it and just trying to understand how it worked. 

My phone measurements for safe keeping üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª

üî∏ **Width:** 81.75mm 

üî∏ **Length:** 165mm

üî∏ **Depth:** 13mm


Here are some annoying b I ran in to:
1. **Vertical vs. Horizontal**

Attempted to make the stand vertical. I struggled with this for a while because what I initially did was reverse the input, so I put length into width and vice versa. Because of this, it was incredibly difficult to adjust the height of the stand itself. I tinkered with this for a LONG time. Finally saw there was an option for Portrait vs Landscape in GS, so started over

2. **Perspective??**

First of all, there are so many views, why?? Second of all, I learned NOT to drag one view into full screen, and to simply double tap the view I want in 4View. Cody was a miracle worker here, because I was deepyly confused.

3. **Plane**

Cody also helped me to set up a plane so I wouldn't lose the object so easy. It basically required typing in plane, placing it on the object, and making sure it's correctly dragged to the object. Great learning yay!

4. **Shake n' Bake n'**

Baking was easy! Learned that this should not be done in perspective view otherwise it was actually bake in perspective. There is a little vroom vroom car that shows it from the top view that was great. Baking was easy, but I just ran into a few issues with exporting this into Illustrator.

I also learned about the Move command and moving the baked portion to 0, because it was floating off into space and not showing up in Illustator. 

## Photo time!

## Outcomes
The final one wasn't put together very well, I believe it was to do with the sizing of the acrylic OR I need to adjust the holes they go in to. TBD!

Learning do be fun sometimes!
